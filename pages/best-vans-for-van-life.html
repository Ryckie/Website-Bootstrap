                If you're reading this, chances are you're probably wondering,
                "what are the best vans for van life?". There are a lot of
                different options out there to choose from and each van model
                has its own pros and cons. Whether you're looking at a Mercedes
                Sprinter, Ford Transit, Dodge Promaster, or even a VW and
                budget-friendly cargo-style vans, there's a lot to consider.
              </p>

              <p>
                Your budget, what you'll be using the van for, and the climates
                you hope to travel in are just a few factors that determine what
                the best van will be for you.

              <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3 text-center">Mercedes Sprinter Vans</h2>
              <p>
                The Sprinter is one of the best vans for van life if it's within
                your budget. The #1 reason for choosing a Sprinter over other
                vehicle types is it's currently the only one with a factory 4x4
                option.
              </p>

              <h4 class="fw-bold text-center">Sprinter Van Pros</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  They get good gas mileage for a vehicle of their size (11,8
                  L/100km for the 2 wheel drive option, 15-16 L/100km in the 4x4
                  option).
                </li>
                <li>
                  They are available in both a 144" and 170" wheelbase for
                  different size options.
                </li>
                <li>
                  They are available in diesel, which means a 600+ km lifetime.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Compared to the other panel vans, Sprinters have a higher
                  payload than the Transit or the Promaster.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Unless you're very tall, most people can stand up inside.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h4 class="fw-bold text-center">Sprinter Van Cons</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  They are expensive off the bat and are expensive to maintain.
                </li>
                <li>They operate on a complex computer system.</li>
                <li>
                  Many mechanics won't work on them, so you are stuck paying
                  dealer prices.
                </li>
                <li>They are prone to rust.</li>
              </ul>

              <h4 class="fw-bold mt-4 text-center">Is 4x4 Worth It?</h4>
              <p>
                Sprinters are expensive to begin with, but the 4x4 upgrade comes
                with an even heftier price tag. 4x4 Sprinters have a 4" higher
                clearance than the standard 2 wheel drive Sprinter and hold
                their value when it comes to resale. However, they are
                significantly less gas efficient than the 2wd version.
              </p>

              <h4 class="fw-bold mt-4 text-center">144" vs 170" Wheelbase</h4>
              <p>
                My first Sprinter was the 144" wheelbase and my second Sprinter
                was the 170" wheelbase which provides about 1,07 meter extra of
                living space. The two wheelbases are very similar in the way
                they drive and both are highly maneuverable.

              <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3 text-center">Ford Transit Vans</h2>
              <p>
                For the first time in 2020, the Ford Transit came out in an
                all-wheel-drive version. It is less expensive than the Sprinter,
                but as of 2021, the all-wheel-drive Ford Transit only comes in a
                gas model.
              </p>

              <h4 class="fw-bold text-center">Ford Transit Pros</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The biggest advantages of the Ford Transit over the Sprinter
                  are the lower cost of maintenance and the fact that you can
                  have it serviced anywhere.
                </li>
                <li>Parts are easy to come by.</li>
                <li>
                  Ford Transits are less expensive upfront compared to
                  Sprinters.
                </li>
                <li>They have the tallest interior height option.</li>
              </ul>

              <h4 class="fw-bold text-center">Ford Transit Cons</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Ford Transits have lower clearance than some of the other van
                  options out there.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The new all-wheel-drive model is only available with a gas
                  engine, not diesel.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Ford Transits are slightly less fuel efficient compared with
                  Sprinters.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <hr class="my-5 opacity-2" />

              <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3 text-center">Dodge Promaster Vans</h2>
              <p>
                The Dodge Promaster is the most economical of the panel-style
                vans, so it's a great option for those on a budget. In contrast
                to the 2wd Transit and Sprinter, the Promaster is front-wheel
                drive which provides more traction but isn't as nimble.
              </p>

              <h4 class="fw-bold text-center">Dodge Promaster Pros</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Most economic of the panel style vans.</li>
                <li>Can average about 13,1 liter per 100km on highways.</li>
                <li>
                  DIY friendly boxy shape with straight lines makes for an
                  easier conversion.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h4 class="fw-bold text-center">Dodge Promaster Cons</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The longest model is about 0,9 meter shorter than the 170"
                  Sprinter, so the Promaster will require you to pack more
                  thoughtfully.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Ground clearance on the Promaster is about 2,5 centimeter less
                  than the 2wd Transit and Sprinter.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Front wheel drive means getting stuck is more common than RWD,
                  AWD, or 4x4 vehicles.

              <p>
                The E-Series is budget-friendly with a huge used market. Some
                have even been converted to 4 wheel drive and these are
                extremely off-road capable. The downside is they are gas
                guzzlers and you cannot stand up inside unless a pop-top has
                been installed.

                These vintage-style vans offer tried and tested layouts, many
                with a pop-top, built-in bed, and a built-in kitchen. However,
                parts are hard to come by and with the age of the vehicle, you
                are bound to run into issues.

                Questions To Ask Yourself
              </h2>
              <p>
                There is no one size fits all solution when it comes to choosing
                the right vehicle for van life. Here are a few questions to ask
                yourself before choosing a van.
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>What is your budget?</strong> If van life imposes too
                  much financial stress on you, you'll be missing the point
                  altogether. The right vehicle for you is one that's within
                  your means.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Part-time or Full-time?</strong> If you plan on living
                  in your van full-time, you may want a shower, a bathroom, and
                  a bit more space. If you're using it for traveling here and
                  there, you might not need these things.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Where will you use it?</strong> If you plan to rally
                  your van on gnarly dirt roads or sand, then 4x4 may be
                  non-negotiable. If you frequently need to go stealth in the
                  city, then you'll want something smaller and more discrete.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>How tall are you?</strong> The Ford Transit has the
                  most interior headspace, followed by the High Roof Sprinter.
                  If you want to stand up inside your van, these and the
                  Promaster are your best options.
                </li>
